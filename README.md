# Group A BBD Vac Week 2023

## GitLab Rules
- keep your group's code in your own folder and branches
- branch naming: `<team_number>/<whatever_you_want>`, e.g. `1/pretty_app_feature`
- main branch for each team should be `<team_number>_main`, e.g. `1_main`
- **DO NOT** push to main branch
- **DO NOT** push to other people's branches
