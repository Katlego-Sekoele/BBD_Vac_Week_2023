# Group A BBD Vac Week 2023

## GitLab Rules
- keep your group's code in your own folder and branches
- branch naming: `<team_number>/<whatever_you_want>`, e.g. `1/pretty_app_feature`
- main branch for each team should be `<team_number>_main`, e.g. `1_main`
- **DO NOT** push to main branch
- **DO NOT** push to other people's branches

### How to pull
- `git pull` (pulls the changes from the current branch)
- 
### How to push
- `git add <file_name>` (adds a file to the commit)
- `git commit -m "<commit_message>"` (commits the changes)
- `git push` (pushes the changes to the cuurent branch)

### How to branch
- `git branch <branch_name>` (creates a new branch)
- `git checkout <branch_name>` (switches to that branch)
- `git checkout -b <branch_name>` (creates a new branch and switches to it)
  
### How to merge
- `git checkout <branch_name>` (switches to the branch you want to merge into)
- `git merge <branch_name>` (merges the branch into the current branch)
